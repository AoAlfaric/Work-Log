Welcome to my weird ass worklog. 
i'll sort things by year, and then by folder. 

This is new for me.
And sometimes sleeping is erratic due to manic episodes. As such:
If i start working on X day, and it goes past 12 pm. 
I will consider that work to still be on X day instead of the next day.
Unless its stupidly close. If i start work at 11pm i'll just put it into the next days folder. 
but sometimes i'll work for over 24 hours so. Its gonna get weird.
